select w1 
from weather w1
join weather w2
on datediff(w1.recordDate, w2recordDate) =1
where w1.temperature > w2.temperature

join does self joining for us to compare 2 tables in same row 
when we from and join and ww1, w2 it creates a copy for us ....

we learnt datediff, self join and copy generation mainly in this one
